# Penguin Data Analysis

## Dataset
This project uses the `penguins_clean.csv` dataset, which contains cleaned measurements for penguin species, including bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, and sex.

## Data Analysis Script
The Stata script `penguins_analysis.do` performs the following tasks:
1. Loads the `penguins_clean.csv` dataset.
2. Runs descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical variables.
3. Produces frequency tables for categorical variables (species and sex).
4. Saves the output to `penguins.log`.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository:
2. Open Stata and load the `.do` script:
3. The analysis results will be saved in `penguins.log`.
